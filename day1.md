We cover alot today. We went over how to write in headings, paragraphs, line breaks, emphais, blockqoutes, list, code, horizontal rule, links, images, and more.
Here is a link to todays reading. [Basic Syanx](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#images-1)

We also learned about basic writing and synax for GitHub. Link to this readin is here. [Markdown on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

All the links are new in the readings that were covered. I am trying to figure out how to lay these pages out there is so much information you could put on these.
